[![Total Projects](https://img.shields.io/badge/total-projects-XX-orange.svg)](./index.md)

A curated collection of fine-tuned code projects across multiple programming languages, focusing on academic research implementations and practical mini-projects. This repository serves as a centralized hub for tracking modified versions of open-source projects, with clear links to original sources.

## 📋 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by programming language, with each language folder containing:

- Multiple projects (both academic paper implementations and small-scale applications)
- An `index.md` file listing original repository URLs for all projects in that folder

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository aims to:

1. **Track modifications**: Maintain a structured record of fine-tuning changes made to open-source projects, avoiding scattered local copies.
2. **Simplify reference**: Centralize links to original repositories for attribution and upstream updates.
3. **Showcase diversity**: Demonstrate practical implementations across programming languages, with a focus on bridging academic research and real-world code.
4. **Facilitate reuse**: Provide easily accessible, modified code snippets for quick integration in future projects.

## 💡 Notes

- All projects in this repository are derived from open-source sources (linked in respective `index.md` files). Original licenses and attributions apply.
- Modifications are minimal and focused on:
  - Bug fixes for specific environments
  - Adaptations for cross-language compatibility
  - Simplifications for educational use
- To contribute or report issues, please open a pull request or issue in the original repository (links provided) rather than this collection.
